Download servers
================

ZOPYX Limited provides the Produce & Publish components through several
download servers (depending on component and permissions).

The following servers must be included with your buildout configuration
using the ``find-links`` directive:

::

    find-links = ...

        # For Plone 3.x (for both client connector and authoring environment V 1.X)
        http://username:password@sdist.zopyx.com

        # For Plone 4.x (Client Connector >= 2.0)
        http://username:password@sdist-pp.zopyx.com

        # For Plone 4.x (Authoring Environment >= 2.0)
        http://username:password@sdist-pp-ae.zopyx.com


For using the Produce & Publish Authoring Environment 2.0 you need to include
the URL for the client connector as well:

::

    find-links = ...
        http://username:password@sdist-pp.zopyx.com
        http://username:password@sdist-pp-ae.zopyx.com
