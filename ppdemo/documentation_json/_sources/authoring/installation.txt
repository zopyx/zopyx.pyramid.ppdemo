Installation
============

This documentation assumes that your installation of Plone/Zope is
based on zc.buildout.


-  edit your *buildout.cfg*
-  add ``zopyx.authoring`` to the ``zcml`` option of
   your buildout.cfg:

::

    find-links = ...

        # for Authoring Environment V 1.X
        http://username:password@sdist.zopyx.com

        # for Authoring Environment V 2.X
        http://username:password@sdist-pp.zopyx.com
        http://username:password@sdist-pp-ae.zopyx.com
    
    eggs = ...
        zopyx.authoring
    

-  re-run *bin/buildout*

-  restart Zope/Plone

-  now either create a new Plone 4 site through the ZMI and select the ``Authoring Environment``
   profile from the list of available extension profiles or

   visit the add-ons control panel within the Plone UI and add
   ``Produce & Publish Authoring Environment`` to the list of installed add-ons
